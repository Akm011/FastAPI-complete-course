uvicorn is the webserver we use to start a FastApi application

To run fastAPI application
    uvicorn books:app --reload
    fastapi dev books.py
    fastapi run books.py 
    

Code flow in fastAPI ---> Top to bottom


path parameter  --> are request parameter that have been attached to URL
                --> defined as a way to find info based on location
                --> Variables that are part of the API URL
                --> %20 in URL means space character

query parameter --> request parameter attached after '?'
                --> can be used along with path parameters
                --> query parameters are indeed used to sort and filter data that isn't specified within the path parameters of the API URL. 

.casefold()     --> handles Unicode characters better:
                   Eg print("straße".lower())    # → "straße"
                      print("straße".casefold()) # → "strasse"

###Order of function written matters
if read_books_by_author_path fn written below read_author_category_by_query it will not work as the api call will get captured by read_author_category_by_query and one parameter is missing

So, smaller API should be in the Top
