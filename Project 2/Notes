FastAPI is now compatible with both Pydantic v1 and Pydantic v2

Based on how new the version of FastAPI you are using, there could be small method name changes.

The three biggest are:
    --->    .dict() function is now renamed to .model_dump()
    --->    schema_extra function within a Config class is now renamed to json_schema_extra
    --->    Optional variables need a =None example: id: Optional[int] = None

Pydantics
    --->    Python library that is used for data modeling, data parsing and has efficient error handling.
    --->    Pydantics is commonly used as a resource for data validation and how to handle data coming to our FastAPI application.
